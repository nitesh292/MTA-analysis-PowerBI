# MTA Post-Pandemic Ridership Trends and Recovery Dashboard
## About the Project
The MTA Post-Pandemic Ridership Trends and Recovery Dashboard focuses on how various services have recovered from the pandemic's effects
. Using data spanning from 2020 to 2024, this dashboard provides insights into recovery patterns across various MTA services, such as Subways, Buses, Bridges and Tunnels, Access-A-Ride, Metro-North Railroad, Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), and Staten Island Railway.
### Tool Used

## Key Matrics 
#### 1. Overall Ridership 
The total number of riders across all MTA services (Subway, Bus, LIRR, Metro-North, Staten Island Railway) from 2020 to 2024
#### 2. Scheduled Trips 
The total number of Access A Ride  trips for all transit options (e.g., buses, trains,subways) in from 2020 to 2024.
#### 3. Traffic Volume (Bridges and Tunnels)
Total number of vehicles passing through MTA bridges and tunnels from 2020 to 2024.
#### 4. Average Recovery Percentage
The percentage of ridership recovery compared to pre-pandemic levels, averaged across all services.
## Visualizations
- **Line Chart** illustrate the recovery trend over time and Ridership comparision over time
- **Bar Chart** Represents the overview of the Riderships, Scheduled Trips and Traffic over Years
- **Matric** Illustrate Average percentage recovery of specific MTA Servics

## Key Insights 
#### 1. **Bridges and tunnels** have demonstrated rapid recovery. Due to the increase usage of personal vehicles then public transport
#### 2. **Staten Island Railway and Metro-North** are recovering at a slower pace, due to shifts in commuter behavior, such as remote work.
#### 3. The recovery of the **Access a Ride** is highest at 126.87 on Oct 2024
#### 4. The **Subway and the Buses** Show highest ridership among all the timeline  indicates people like to use public transport to travel  in urban areas
